### External Dependencies
| ID | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Raisekit backend will run on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/infrastructure/design) which offers network security like firewalls and network segmentation, Identity and access management, DDos protection, etc. |
| 2 | Frontend and database is host on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules). Firebase provides security measures such as: Authentication, App Check (verifies that requests come from the app and are made by a genuine user), Cloud Storage Security Rules that enables control over access to files. Also Realtime Database Security Rules to specify who can read, write and update data based on defined conditions. And Security Monitoring tools to detect, identify and respond to security events in the application. |
| 3 | Backend and database connect over public internet. |
| 4 | GCP use Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol on Network layer, TLS protocol on Transport layer and HTTPs, SMTP, TLS on Application layer. |

### Cyber Security Implemented Measures
- HTML sanitization in user input login fields. Prevent XSS attacks using [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify) library.
- Encode user input with [he](https://www.npmjs.com/package/he) library.
- Sanitization with [xss] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/xss) library. Another sanitizer for potentially untrusted HTML.
